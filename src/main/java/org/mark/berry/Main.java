//        Application requirements
//
//        By using the application, the user should be able to do the following:
//
//          •	Create a new property record
//          •	Create a new buyer or seller record
//          •	Create a new (property) sale record
//          •	Search and display an existing sale record based on saleId
//
//        Design guidelines:
//
//        In your application, you can use a menu of your choice and you can create the
//        above mentioned-required objects and store them in the respective ArrayLists.
//        If there are no property or a buyer or a seller, then a sale cannot occur.
//        Hence, you have to make sure that the required values are available for a sale.
//        You may also note that a property can be sold many times over a period of time.
//        Hence, additional fields can be used in the classes to find out whether a property
//        is available for sale or sold out.  (optional) You may assume that a property is
//        sold only once in any one day.
